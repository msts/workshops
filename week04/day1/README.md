# Research & Discussion

## Problem statement

Spend the first ten minutes researching a tenet of web scale architecture and

tenet provides to the overall solution and how they support each other. The
tenets are: horizontal scaling, shared nothing, multiple tiers, commodity
hardware, and minimal management.
