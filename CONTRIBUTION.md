## What should I know before I get started?

The contribution should align with the workshop goals and conform to the constraints.

### Workshop Goals
1. Introduce people to tools and methods that arenâ€™t used here to foster curiosity
1. Help people establish cross-team working relationships in low risk, low pressure environments
1. Serve as a way for people to disconnect from their daily, muddled problems and think on something more constrained


### Constraints
* 30 minute session
* No Pre-work
* No Post-work

## How can I contribute?
Workshops are always changing. As the audience changes and grows, the material to needs to adjust to stay relevant. If you feel like something needs to change, change it.

1. Fork the project
1. Make the change on your repository
1. Submit a Pull Request to the MSTS/Workshops repository
1. Participate in the discussion that will form around the Pull Request

### Suggest an enhancement
The existing sessions are launching off points to facilitate discussion. If you feel like additional information would make a workshop session better, make the change you would like to see.

### Build a Session
The workshops started out for developers, so they are developer centric. The audience is changing, so we are excited to incorporate additional perspectives. Use a lesson template as a starting point to build a session.

#### Brainstorm list of subject areas for additional sessions
* Testing
* QA
* Security
* Database Administration
* Engineering for Accounting Practices
* Compliance
* Dev Ops
* Network Management
* Web basics

### Pull Requests
Pull requests are a starting point for discussion. The goal of the Review process is to keep the alignment of the project consistent across diverse Pull Requests.
