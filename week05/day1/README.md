# Research and Discussion

## Problem statement

Spend the first ten minutes researching a type of database and then give a five
minute or less lightning talk. Focus on what the primary use case is, if it is
generally stand-alone or an add-on to another type of database, and what its
strengths and weaknesses are. Some types are: Relational (RDBMS), document,
full-text, graph, key/value store, flat file, geospatial, columnar, and object.
