# Least Cost Pathing Algorithms

## Problem statement

Research either the Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra least-cost pathing algorithm for
ten minutes, then give a five minute or less lightning talk on what you’ve
learned.

## Goal

* Practice evaluating solutions for their strengths and weaknesses.
* Be confident speaking authoritatively to a group.

## Discussion points

* The team may need to be introduced to graph data, including the concepts of
  “nodes” and “edges”.
* Dijkstra is generally more efficient, however Bellman-Ford can handle edges
  with negative weights.
* Discuss places in our company where these types of algorithms can be used.
